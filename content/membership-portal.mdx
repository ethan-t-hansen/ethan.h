    "UBCMA stands as UBC's only marketing focused club. Each year, the club sells membership to students and hosts events through Showpass, which offers limited features to suit the club's needs.  Our team built a centralized web application to replace this process, ultimately decreasing costs, streamlining workflows, and fostering community",

  body1="The UBCMA Membership Portal is a centralized platform designed to
      manage the lifecycle of a studentâ€™s membership in the club. From event
      registration and ticketing to alumni networking and job listings, the
      portal empowers both members and club executives with intuitive,
      role-based tools."
  body2="Our primary goal was to provide a seamless experience for students to feel
      like a member of a community, and to help our internal exec team make
      data-driven decisions. We facilitated this by offering exclusive access to
      events, opportunities, and perks such as discounts and private job
      postings. We built out an admin dashboard that ran queries on our database
      and displayed insightful revenue and demographic data for our execs on a
      dashboard."

      <div className="text-sm font-light">
        Railway proved to be a user friendly and cost-effective solution to manage our express backend, Postgres database, and Redis instance all in one place. We used Stripe SDK for secure payment infrastructure, Better auth for a simple authentication solution compatible with TypeScript and Express, and GitHub for version control. Our frontend is a Next.js + React application styled with Tailwind + ShadCN and deployed on vercel.
