# Project Overview

BizTech Web v2 is the next generation of UBC BizTech's event portal, designed to enhance user experience and streamline event management. This project involved a complete redesign and redevelopment of the existing platform, focusing on modern design principles and robust backend architecture.

## Business Impact

The event portal supports **thousands** of registrations annually, facilitating seamless event management for both organizers and attendees. The new platform aims to improve user engagement, increase registration rates, and provide a more efficient workflow for event coordinators.
