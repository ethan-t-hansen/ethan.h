#### OVERVIEW

# Networking is hard. We made it easier to stay connected.

BluePrint is UBC BizTech's flagship conference designed to empower students with the tools and connections they need to thrive in the tech industry. Its UBC's largest technology conference, boasting **270+** attendees, **80+** partners, and attracting **40+** companies from the likes of **Google**, **Tesla**, and **Meta** annually. This year's theme revolved around _Getting Your Start_ and helping students initiate their first step into tech.

The biggest pain point with tech events? **_Networking_**. Lining up for 30 minutes to speak with someone you don't know just for the chance at an opportunity, fumbling with your phone and trying to find someone's LinkedIn to connect, and then having to remember everyone after the fact makes these events _exhausting_.

#### PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION

# We did some research into how people really feel about networking.

In a survey done with 100 previous attendees, we discovered that the issue is not just{" "} _forming_ these connections, but also _maintaining_ them long after the event is over. On top of this, students felt as though it was difficult to navigate the overwhelming atmosphere of these events while having these conversations.

/>

Its clear that conference attendees are coming to BluePrint to make meaningful connections, but have trouble remembering who they have talked to and where to find them, making it difficult to quantify the value they received by attending.

# How might we foster the connections between attendees and delegates made at BluePrint and highlight the value that each attendee gained by attending?

#### SOLUTION

# We made everything accessible through the tap of a card.

We knew that our solution needed an _X-factor_ that got people talking without compromising on user experience. NFC technology presented an opportunity to do all three of those. Each attendees nametag came with an NFC card inside, and by holding your mobile device up to someone's nametag you instantly gained access to a custom profile which had their LinkedIn, company, and fun facts about them. We ingested event signup data into a backend service that generated these profiles automatically. Each NFC card was then mapped to a custom profile URL for each attendee.

## We remember who you meet so you can focus on the present.

We developed a system that persists **_connections_** between two people, which we defined as everyone who visits your profile and everyone whose profile you have visited. This way, anyone could get a long list of everyone they met at the event. After the event had ended, we launched a recap similar to Spotify Wrapped, where you could look back on what you accomplished and check out what everyone else got up to.

#### NEXT STEPS

# What if we extended beyond the scope of a single event?

Coming off the resounding success of the BluePrint NFC cards, BizTech decided to start a new initiative - **_Membership Cards_**. Any individual who signs up as a member receives a membership card that keeps track of connections throughout every single BizTech event and also allows them to checkin at the door.
