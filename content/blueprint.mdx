  body1="This project was spread across 3 months of intensive planning by
        developers and project managers. Our goal was to elevate the
        experience of attendees attending our event through a novel and
        innovative experience that you could not find anywhere else. We
        aimed to exceed the expectations set for us as a student-run
        organization by building a large-scale product that had real-world
        impact."
  body2="This project focused on creating a never-before-seen conference
        experience, giving each attendee a personalized account on a
        cloud-based web application that enabled quick and seamless
        networking. The web app features personalized profiles, venue maps,
        an achievement system, and a connection journal that allows
        attendees to track their journey throughout the event."

  h2="SITUATION"
  body1="First introduced in 2017, BluePrint is UBC BizTech&apos;s flagship
      conference designed to empower students with the tools and connections
      they need to thrive in the tech industry. It is known as UBC&apos;s
      largest technology conference, boasting 200+ attendees and 80+ delegates,
      and attracting 40+ companies from the likes of Google, Tesla, and Meta
      annually. This year&apos;s theme revolved around “Getting Your Start”,
      where our goal was to help student&apos;s put their first step forward
      into the world of technology."
  body2="The question was: how do we innovate? Previous iterations of
      Blueprint had seen &quot;gamified&quot; networking, where attendees had
      been rewarded for scanning the QR codes of partners through points towards
      raffle prizes. However, we wanted to get rid of the superficiality of
      students only talking with delegates to gather more points. We also wanted
      to polish the networking experience by eliminating the common pain points
      associated with networking."

      <h3>RESEARCH + INSIGHTS</h3>
      <div className="text-xs font-light">
        We wanted to uncover how people really felt about networking conferences
        to unveil insights about how we can improve them. In a survey done with
        100 previous attendees, we discovered that the issue is not just{" "}
        <i> forming </i> these connections, but also <i> maintaining </i> them
        long after the event is over. On top of this, students felt as though it
        was difficult to navigate the overwhelming atmosphere of these events
        while having these conversations.

    <h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
    <div className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-medium tracking-tight">
      Conference attendees come to BluePrint to make meaningful connections but
      have trouble remembering who they have talked to and where to find them.
      This leaves negative sentiment towards conferences and networking events,
      but also leaves an opportunity for us to innovate.

    <h3>FRAMING A SOLUTION</h3>
    <div className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-medium tracking-tight">
      How might we foster the connections between attendees and delegates made
      at BluePrint and highlight their personal growth through the event long
      after it has concluded?

      <h3>OUR SOLUTION</h3>
      <div className="text-sm font-light">
        Our team of six developers, one project manager, and myself built a
        mobile web app that generates BluePrint user profiles upon event
        registration for each conference attendee and delegate, and designed
        a system that keeps track of &quot;connections&quot;, which we
        defined as everyone who visits your profile and everyone whose
        profile you have visited.

      <h3>LEVERAGING NFC TECHNOLOGY</h3>
      <div className="text-sm font-light">
        We wanted our solution to be functional, easy to use, but still come
        with a <i> wow-factor </i> that gets people talking - NFC technology
        presented an opportunity to do all three of those. Each attendees
        nametag came with an NFC card inside, and by holding your mobile
        device up to someone&apos;s nametag you instantly gained access to
        their profile which had their LinkedIn, company, and fun facts about
        them. Any tap interaction between two people would be counted as a
        connection, and party A would appear in party B&apos;s connections
        journal (and vice versa).

      BluePrint 2025 was a resounding success, with over 200 attendees and
      80 delegates, and 40+ companies in attendance. The NFC technology
      proved to be a hit, with attendees raving about how easy it was to
      connect with others and how they could easily remember who they had
      talked to. The connections journal had resounding success, with attendees
      appreciating the ability to look back at who they had met and what
      they had talked about.
