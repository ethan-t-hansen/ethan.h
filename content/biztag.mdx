# Project Overview

University events like conferences, case competitions, and hackathons are more than just fun—they're core to student growth. These experiences blend creativity, networking, and real-world problem-solving. 

If you've ever attended one of these events, you might notice that professional partners have name tags around their neck. Designing these name tags can take hours of manual work to make the layouts consistent and audit for content mistakes. But what if all that work could be done with the click of a button?

That’s where BizTag comes in.

# Meet BizTag

BizTag is a powerful Figma plugin that is built by a designer, for designers. The app communicates with Figma's Plugin API to build a series of clean, customizable, and organized name tags.

All it takes is a background image with a resolution of your choosing, and a .csv file populated with information on your event partners, and you can generate dozens of name tags instantly. The plugin automatically places name, company, and pronouns on the frontside, and generates a QR code to place on the backside using a QR code API.

Each frame comes with auto layout, enabling ease of customizability for the designer.

# Impact

BizTag has been used to generate nametags for many BizTech events as well as assets for [NSCC](https://www.thenscc.com/), saving dozens of hours of manual labor. The plugin is featured in Figma Community with **109** users.
