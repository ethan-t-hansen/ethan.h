    "Designers spend hours manually porting names from a spreadsheet into their designs to create nametags and other custom visual assets. Figma lacked the features to deal with variable data like Adobe, but their plugin API ecosystem left potential for an open source solution to this common problem.",

    body1="University events like conferences, case competitions, and hackathons are more than just fun—they're core to student growth. These experiences blend creativity, networking, and real-world problem-solving. But behind the scenes, organizers often face time-consuming design tasks, such as creating name tags for professional partners. That’s where BizTag comes in."
    body2="BizTag is a Figma plugin I built to automate the entire name tag creation workflow. By integrating with Figma’s Plugin API and a third-party QR code generator, BizTag instantly produces front-and-back name tags for event partners—no manual layout work needed."
