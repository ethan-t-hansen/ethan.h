    "An app that makes being spontaneous a little easier. Spawn lets you casually let your friends in on what you're up to, and see what your friends are doing in real-time. Whether it's a spontaneous trip to the beach or a last-minute dinner, Spawn helps you connect with friends and make the most of your free time.",

  body1="Coordinating plans with your friends can be frustrating, especially last minute. In your 20s especially, everyone is at different stages of their lives and it can be hard to find a single time to get together and create memories - the status quo becomes scrolling social media for hours instead of going out there and having fun."
  body2="Spawn started as a simple hackathon idea to build an app that helps you connect with others, spontaneously. We wanted to minimize those 'Hey, are you guys free on this day?' messages that get left on read for 24 hours, and ensure you never have to consider when2meet. Instead, we wanted a way to casually let your network know what you're up to, and give them the option to join in on the fun at their leisure."

    <div className="text-xl md:text-2xl font-medium tracking-tight">
      Planning individually is time consuming, and messaging group chats can
      feel like talking to a wall. Although people clearly want to get out and
      have fun with their friends, having to plan so far in advance makes
      scrolling instagram reels that much more inticing.

      How might reduce the friction in the activity-planning process, and
