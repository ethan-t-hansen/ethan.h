    "An app that makes being spontaneous a little easier. Spawn lets you casually let your friends in on what you're up to, and see what your friends are doing in real-time. Whether it's a spontaneous trip to the beach or a last-minute dinner, Spawn helps you connect with friends and make the most of your free time.",

  body1="Coordinating plans with your friends can be frustrating, especially last minute. In your 20s especially, everyone is at different stages of their lives and it can be hard to find a single time to get together and create memories - the status quo becomes scrolling social media for hours instead of going out there and having fun."
  body2="Spawn started as a simple hackathon idea to build an app that helps you connect with others, spontaneously. We wanted to minimize those 'Hey, are you guys free on this day?' messages that get left on read for 24 hours, and ensure you never have to consider when2meet. Instead, we wanted a way to casually let your network know what you're up to, and give them the option to join in on the fun at their leisure."
