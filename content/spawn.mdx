# Project Overview

Spawn started as a hackathon project with a simple idea - make spontaneous planning simple. Coordinating plans with your friends can be frustrating, especially in cold and rainy Vancouver. In our city in particular, it can sometimes feel like our friends need 5 days of notice to go out for an hour, and the status quo becomes scrolling social media for hours instead of going out and having fun.

## Fostering Spontaneity

The purpose of the app was to remove the friction in plan making, but that was a difficult UX task. How can we make something more intuitive and casual than google calendar while still offering all of the data that is needed to plan an event?
