# Project Overview

Vancouver Dwelling is a real estate company based in Vancouver, BC. I worked with them to redesign their website to better showcase their property listings and services. The goal was to create a modern, user-friendly website that would attract potential clients and provide them with the information they need to make informed decisions about buying or selling property.
